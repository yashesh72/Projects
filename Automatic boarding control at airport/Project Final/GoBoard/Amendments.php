  <p id="para" style="text-align:justify"><b>Amendments:</b><br><br>Every booking made on Goibibo is subject to amendment charges levied by the airline, which may vary by flight and booking class.
    In case of Online Reschedule, the existing booking id will be auto cancelled with applicable airlines cancellation charges and a fresh booking id will be generated as per current pricing.
    If you amend your booking, you will be charged the difference in fare, if any, applicable when the amendment is made. However if the new fare is lower than the Original fare, difference in the amount will not be refunded,but the rebooking charges as applicable will be collected
    In addition to the airline's amendment charges, Goibibo charges an amendment handling fee of Rs 300 per passenger per sector.
    We'll collect these charges from you when we make the changes to your travel plans. We'll also collect the difference in fare, if any, applicable when the amendment is made.
    Depending on the airline's policy, some booked fares may not be amended.
    All bookings made through us, can also be amended by calling up the Airline Call Center directly.
    For any amendments related to multi-itinerary reservations, call the 24x7 customer care numbers 09213025552 / 1860 258 5858
